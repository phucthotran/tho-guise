Self-hosted web app for managing per-recipient email aliases on a [`docker-mailserver`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) instance, without SSH. Generates random alias addresses labeled with the service they're for, e.g. `g-a3f82c11-netflix@example.com`, and routes them to your real mailbox. Bitwarden's *Forwarded email alias* generator can create them directly from any sign-up form (via a SimpleLogin-compatible API; see below).

Auth piggybacks on the mailserver itself (IMAP), so there's no separate user database. Aliases live in `postfix-virtual.cf`, and the embedded label travels in the address itself — guise owns no application data of its own beyond a regenerable session key.

## Why random aliases instead of sub-addressing?

A sub-addressed address (e.g. `user+netflix@example.com`) reveals your real mailbox to anyone who reads it. If one service leaks its user list and addresses follow `user+<service>@…`, an attacker can probe `user+<every-other-service>@…` to link your identity across services. Random-prefix aliases break both: `g-a3f82c11-netflix@example.com` reveals nothing about the mailbox and doesn't correlate with `g-5b2e1c8a-bank@example.com`. The embedded label is just operator ergonomics — sub-addressing has "which alias did I use here?" for free, and the label is how guise gets that back.

```

`server/` builds the image; the running deployment is a sidecar service inside your `docker-mailserver` compose project. Prebuilt images are published to GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/messelink/guise` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Quickstart

Add the two services below to your `docker-mailserver` `compose.yaml`, alongside the existing `mailserver` service. The `guise-socket-proxy` sidecar restricts guise's Docker API access to only the container-listing and exec endpoints it needs to write aliases — an RCE in guise can no longer touch the host Docker daemon directly. See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) for the trust-boundary rationale.

```yaml
  guise-socket-proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest
    container_name: guise-socket-proxy
    restart: always
    environment:
      CONTAINERS: 1   # allow GET on /containers/*
      EXEC: 1         # allow POST on /containers/{id}/exec and /exec/{id}/start
      POST: 1         # allow POST requests in general
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    # not exposed on the host; only reachable from the project's docker network

  guise:
    image: ghcr.io/messelink/guise:latest
    container_name: guise
    restart: always
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:9100:8000"]
    volumes:
      - ./guise-data:/data
    environment:
      GUISE_DOMAIN: example.com               # your mail domain
      GUISE_TAG: g-
      GUISE_DENIED_USERS: noreply,admin,bot   # service accounts to block
      GUISE_MAILSERVER_CONTAINER: mailserver
      GUISE_IMAP_HOST: mailserver
      GUISE_IMAP_PORT: "993"
      DATA_DIR: /data
      SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE: "true"
      DOCKER_HOST: tcp://guise-socket-proxy:2375
    depends_on:
      - mailserver
      - guise-socket-proxy
```

Then from your docker-mailserver compose project directory:

```
mkdir -p guise-data
docker compose pull guise guise-socket-proxy
docker compose up -d guise guise-socket-proxy
```

To pin a specific version instead of tracking `:latest`, use `ghcr.io/messelink/guise:0.3.0` (or any tag from the [Releases page](https://github.com/messelink/guise/releases)). Upgrades are then a `docker compose pull guise && docker compose up -d --force-recreate guise`.

### Build from source instead

If you'd rather not pull a prebuilt image:

```
cd guise/server
make build         # produces local guise:latest
```

…then use `image: guise:latest` in the compose block above.

## Reverse proxy

guise listens on container port `8000`, mapped to `127.0.0.1:9100` on the host by default. Anything that can terminate TLS and forward to it works.

If you already have a reverse proxy **on the host** (system Apache, Caddy, nginx, …), point it at `127.0.0.1:9100`. The simplest Caddyfile entry:

```Caddyfile
guise.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9100
}
```

If you have an existing reverse-proxy **container** on the same compose project, point it at `guise:8000` directly (docker-network DNS), bypassing the host-port mapping.

If you don't already have any reverse proxy, drop a `compose.override.yaml` alongside your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    container_name: guise-reverse-proxy
    restart: always
    ports: ["80:80", "443:443"]
    volumes:
      - caddy-data:/data
    configs:
      - source: caddy-config
        target: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
    depends_on:
      - guise

volumes:
  caddy-data:

configs:
  caddy-config:
    content: |
      guise.example.com {
        reverse_proxy guise:8000
      }
```

`docker compose up -d` auto-merges `*.override.yaml`. Caddy auto-provisions a Let's Encrypt cert for `guise.example.com`, redirects HTTP → HTTPS, and forwards to guise over the docker network. To disable, delete the file.

**Header trust**: guise enables `ProxyFix` (`x_for=1, x_proto=1, x_host=1`) so `request.remote_addr` reflects the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` and `request.is_secure` reflects HTTPS termination at the proxy. This is correct only if guise is reached exclusively through the reverse proxy. If guise is also reachable directly (e.g. you bind it to `0.0.0.0:9100`), a malicious client can spoof those headers — keep the bind on `127.0.0.1` and front everything through the proxy.

## SimpleLogin-compatible API

guise exposes the subset of the [SimpleLogin REST API](https://github.com/simple-login/app/blob/master/docs/api.md) that password-manager "forwarded email alias" generators rely on. Any client that supports pointing at a *self-hosted* SimpleLogin server should be able to create guise aliases without modification.

Point your client at `https://guise.example.com`; the API key is your mailbox short-username and IMAP password joined by `:` — same auth path as the web UI, no separate token to manage. For example, if your mailbox is `alice@example.com` and your IMAP password is `s3cret-imap-password`, the API key is `alice:s3cret-imap-password`.

Bitwarden is the verified-working client (browser extension, mobile, desktop). Any other SimpleLogin client with a self-hosted server URL setting should also work — open an issue if you confirm one. Auto-labeling from the request URL is opt-out per instance via `GUISE_API_AUTOLABEL=0`.

Full request/response spec, error codes, and the SimpleLogin subset implemented are in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md).

## User flow

### Via the web UI

1. Browse to `https://guise.example.com/login`
2. Log in with your short mailserver username + password
3. Dashboard shows two sections:
   - **Managed by guise** — addresses starting with `g-`, with their labels
   - **Other aliases routing to you** — anything else in `postfix-virtual.cf` pointing to your address (pre-existing aliases). Deleting one of these prompts an extra confirmation.
4. Type a label, click *Create alias* → fresh `g-<8 hex>-<label>` address appears, ready to copy.
5. Click *delete* on any alias to remove it.

### Via Bitwarden

1. In Bitwarden, configure *Username Generator → Forwarded email alias → SimpleLogin (self-hosted server)*. Server URL: `https://guise.example.com` (no path). **API key** is a single string `username:imap-password` (e.g. `thotran:s3cret` or `thotran@example.com:s3cret`) — not a separate SimpleLogin token. If the password itself contains `:`, use the web UI instead or change the password.
2. On any sign-up form, focus the email/username field. Bitwarden's in-page bubble offers *Generate*: pick *Forwarded email alias* → a fresh `g-<random>-<site>@<domain>` alias appears and gets pasted.
3. Manage or delete the alias later via the web UI's *Managed by guise* section.

## Rollback

```
docker compose stop guise guise-socket-proxy
docker compose rm -f guise guise-socket-proxy
# remove both service blocks from compose.yaml
rm -rf guise-data
docker image rm ghcr.io/messelink/guise:latest tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest
```

Mailserver is untouched.
